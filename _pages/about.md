Iâ€™m a PhD student at the  [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Lab](https://www.aiml.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de), TU Darmstadt. My main research interests cover a broad range of Machine Learning related topics such as deep models, tractable probabilistic circuits and their applications in computer vision. In specific, I work on bridging the gap between probabilistic circuits and deep neural networks. We want to push the limits of Sum-Product Networks and aim to combine their strengths with the modeling capacity of neural networks.
