describe how we can train this model in a deterministic manner

visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to
fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the
corresponding words in the output sequence. We validate the

abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversar- ial process; in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution; and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather thanG. The train- ing procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D; a unique solution exists; with G recovering the training data distribution andD equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G andD are defined by multilayer perceptrons; the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net- works during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples. 1},

abstract = {We present a new method that views object detection as a direct set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection pipeline, effectively removing the need for many hand-designed components like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation that explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main ingredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or DETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time performance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. Moreover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation in a unified manner. We show that it significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Training code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr.},

abstract = {Large Convolutional Network models have recently
demonstrated impressive classification performance on the
ImageNet benchmark Krizhevsky et al. [18]. However there is no
clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they
might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We
introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight
into the function of intermediate feature layers and the
operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these
visualizations allow us to find model architectures that
outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification
benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the
performance contribution from different model layers. We show
our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when
the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the
current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and
Caltech-256 datasets.},

abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82{\%} top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

@inproceedings{krogh1991weightdecay,
abstract = {It has been observed in numerical simulations that a weight
decay can improve generalization in a feed-forward neural
network. This paper explains why. It is proven that a weight
decay has two effects in a linear network. First, it
suppresses any irrelevant components of the weight vector by
choosing the smallest vector that solves the learning problem.
Second, if the size is chosen right, a weight decay can
suppress some of the effects of static noise on the targets,
which improves generalization quite a lot. It is then shown
how to extend these results to networks with hidden layers and
non-linear units. Finally the theory is confirmed by some
numerical simulations using the data from NetTalk.},

Equivariant networks have shown excellent performance and data efficiency on vision and medical imaging problems that exhibit symmetries. Here we show how this principle can be extended beyond global symmetries to local gauge transformations. This enables the development of a very general class of convolutional neural networks on manifolds that depend only on the intrinsic geometry,
and which includes many popular methods from equivariant and geometric deep learning. We implement gauge equivariant CNNs for signals defined on the surface of the icosahedron,
which provides a reasonable approximation of the sphere. By choosing to work with this very regular manifold,
we are able to implement the gauge equivariant convolution using a single conv2d call,
making it a highly scalable and practical alternative to Spherical CNNs. Using this method,
we demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods on the task of segmenting omnidirectional images and global climate patterns.},
